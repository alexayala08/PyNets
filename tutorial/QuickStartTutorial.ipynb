    "# A PyNets Primer in Python and Bash\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker/Singularity containers are the preferable way to run PyNets because the compute environment will include all optional dependencies, fully unlocked plotting capabilities, and will perform predictably and with fully reproducible numerical precision. To keep things simple for this demonstration, however, let's begin by just installing PyNets in a virtual environment and then run the workflow manually on some example data. The scope of this tutorial will cover single-subject workflows. For more examples (i.e. including usage with docker/singularity), see: https://pynets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we will explore the package interactively in the code that follows, bear in mind that PyNets is a *workflow*, not a library like its core dependencies (Dipy, Nilearn, Nipype, Networkx). Thus, demonstrating its usage is fundamentally a command-line endeavor, rather than a purely pythonic one to which you may be typically accustomed. \n",
    "\n",
    "PyNets was intentionally designed to scale with supercomputers, but also run using just a couple cores on your local laptop. Although this tutorial is designed to explore the latter use-case, ideally the user will also have (or acquire) **systems-level** thinking (an awareness of issues relevant to distributed/parallel computing) in order to make the most of what PyNets has to offer. Recall that the uniqueness of the PyNets workflow, unlike any other software for brain network modeling, is that it is intended to facilitate a more reproducible ensemble connectome learning which, to be performed efficiently, warrants the use of HPC or AWS cloud infrastructures.

This wide range of execution times stems from the fact that ensemble sampling in PyNets is 'embaressingly parallelizable' across estimations, with no ceiliing on scalability other than available compute resources. For the example below, for instance, if you had access to 68 vCPUs (as is found on TACC's Stampede2, for instance), with plenty of free RAM on a large-memory node, you could arrive at the 144 connectome samples in the time it takes to sample just one!"

Bear in mind, however, that across our ensemble sample, we are **actually** sampling 20,000 x 72 = 1.4 million streamlines! And since we are further employing ensemble tractography, which samples across 5 step sizes (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5) and 2 curvature thresholds (30, 40) by default, we are actually indirectly sampling across a much wider grid of parameters still.\n",
