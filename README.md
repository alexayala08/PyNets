About
-----
PyNets is a tool for sampling and analyzing varieties of individual structural and functional connectomes. PyNets enables the user to specify any of a several of methodological choices known to impact brain network node and/or edge definition, and then sample the prescribed connectome estimates in a massively parallel framework that in turn becomes conducive to grid-search and multi-view learning. PyNets is a post-processing workflow, which means that it can be run on virtually any preprocessed fMRI or dMRI data. It draws from Dipy, Nilearn, GrasPy, and Networkx libraries, but is powered primarily through the Nipype workflow engine. PyNets can now also be deployed as a BIDS application, where it takes BIDS derivatives and makes BIDS derivatives.

Install
-------
Dockerhub (preferred):
```
docker pull dpys/pynets:latest
```

Manual (Requires a local dependency install of FSL version >=5.0.9 and forked version of Nilearn 0.6.0):
```
pip install pynets --user
```
or
```
git clone https://github.com/dpys/pynets
cd PyNets
pip install -r requirements.txt --user
python setup.py install

```

where the `-config` flag specifies that path to a .json configuration spec that includes at least one of many possible connectome recipes to apply to your data. Pre-built configuration files are included in the pynets/config directory, and an example is shown here (with commented descriptions):

```
